# First entry

Today, a bunch of other people and I spent a lot of time trouble shooting issues that ultimately boiled down to getting local URLs wrong.  Seems like a very common oversight.

Also, I found out that the reason I can't get my HTML to render before the Javascript prompts is because of the way Chrome/Safari handle files.  Where as firefox renders files in the order I would prefer.
